Bank 3370 - The Cloud Bank of the Future

Installation Instructions:
Bank 3370 is a Python Flask application, leveraging popular APIs such as WTForms, and SQLAlchemy.
This project contains a requirements.txt file which contains the name of all the Python packages that
need to be installed in order for the project to run. If you're using JetBrain's PyCharm IDE,
opening this file will prompt you to install all the requirements automatically. 

Once the requirements are installed, simply run \__init\__.py located at: 
Bank3370_Python/appdir/\__init\__.py 

This will start the Flask development server running on your local machine on port 5000.
